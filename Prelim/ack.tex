I would like to thank my advisor, Gene, for all his help with this thesis. He originally suggested the topic of research, and since then he has been giving guidance and feedback on my work. This thesis would not have been possible without his help, and I greatly appreciated having him as an advisor.

I would also like to thank the rest of my committee -- Tasso Kaper, Margaret Beck, Ryan Goh, and Mark Kon -- for reading through my thesis, giving feedback, and assisting me through this process. I greatly appreciate the time they have given in helping me complete my dissertation.

Besides my work on this thesis, I have also been involved in research with Julio Castrillon and Mark Kon. I have enjoyed the work I have done with them, and I would like to acknowledge and thank them for their mentorship.

On the personal side, I would like to thank my parents, Michael Norton and Cheryl Holt. They have always encouraged and supported my further education, and so I would not have gotten to this point without them.

Finally, I would like to thank my partner, Stuart Cline. He has been loving, supportive, and patient throughout the research and writing of this thesis. I cannot thank him enough for everything.
